# exercism-python-docker

Create and run a container to work on exercises in the Python track of [Exercism](https://exercism.org), on Windows.

This was a self-learning project. Resources I found most useful: the [Docker reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/) and [Python Speed](https://pythonspeed.com/). 

## Instructions

1) Install Docker and the WSL if not already installed.
2) Add `token.txt` file with your Exercism CLI token to the root folder. 
3) Run `.\build_image.bat`
4) Run `.\create_container.bat`
